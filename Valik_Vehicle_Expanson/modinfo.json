    "description": "Adds diesel engines smaller than the V6, as well as ethanol-burning engines of all sizes. Adds versions of common vehicles (Car, Pickup etc.) for both. (Re)-introduces the Hybrid Car and the Luxury Car from DDA. You'll also be able to create orky jury-rigged engines with access to advanced mechanics books, which will guzzle all your lamp oil. Load AFTER any mods that seriously mess with vehicle placement (such as PK's Rebalance). CONTAINS A TWEAKED VERSION OF CARS TO WRECKS, do not load Cars to Wrecks together with this mod. As of 1.1, also contains new flintlocks.",
